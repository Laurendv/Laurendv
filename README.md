# Hi there, I'm Lauren! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an entrepreneur with an interest in data. I am mildly proefficient in Python, Postgres, Celery, Web Scraping (Scrapy), Django, Docker, Git, AlpineJS, HTMX, and JavaScript. I have built a few applications that automate data processes. I enjoy creating simple and scalable solutions that solve real problems.
